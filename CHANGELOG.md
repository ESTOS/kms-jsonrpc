## [6.8.0] - 2018-09-26

### Fixed
- clang-tidy fixes

## [6.7.0] - 2018-01-24

### Changed
- CMake: Compile and link as Position Independent Code ('-fPIC').

## [1.1.3] - 2017-07-24

### Changed
- Old ChangeLog.md moved to the new format in this CHANGELOG.md file.
- CMake: Full review of all CMakeLists.txt files to tidy up and homogenize code style and compiler flags.
- CMake: Position Independent Code flags ("-fPIC") were scattered around projects, and are now removed. Instead, the more CMake-idiomatic variable "CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE" is used.
- CMake: All projects now compile with "[-std=c11|-std=c++11] -Wall -Werror -pthread".
- CMake: Debug builds now compile with "-g -O0" (while default CMake used "-O1" for Debug builds).
- CMake: include() and import() commands were moved to the code areas where they are actually required.
